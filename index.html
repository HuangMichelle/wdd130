        <p>Hello! My name is Michelle Huang. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and aim to graduate this semester. I am currently interning as a Software Developer Intern with FamilySearch and simultaneously seeking employment opportunities for post-graduation. I'm thrilled to expand my knowledge of web development and gain hands-on experience. I indulge in numerous hobbies, including practicing yoga, spending quality time with loved ones, spontaneous road trips, and at times just catching up on sleep. I have included a picture of myself in my normal element, relishing a sushi feast at a Japanese restaurant.</p>
